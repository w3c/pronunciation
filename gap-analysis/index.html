    <p>This document is the Gap Analysis Review which presents required features of Spoken Text Pronunciation and
      Presentation and existing standards or specifications that may support (or enable support) of those features. Gaps
      are defined when a
      required feature does not have a corresponding method by which it can be authored in HTML.</p>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Accurate, consistent pronunciation and presentation of content spoken by text to speech synthesis (TTS) is an
      essential requirement in education and other domains. Organizations such as educational publishers and assessment
      vendors are
      looking for a standards-based solution to enable authoring of spoken presentation guidance in HTML which can then
      be consumed by assistive technologies and other applications which utilize text to speech synthesis for rendering
      of content.</p>
    <p>W3C has developed two standards pertaining to the presentation of speech synthesis which have reached
      recommendation status, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis11/">Speech Synthesis Markup Language</a>
      (SSML) and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pronunciation-lexicon/">Pronunciation Lexicon Specification</a>
      (PLS). Both standards are directly consumed by a speech synthesis engine supporting those standards. While a PLS
      file reference may be referenced in a HTML
      page using <code>link rel</code>, there is no known uptake of PLS using this method by assistive technologies.
      While there are technically methods to allow authors to inline SSML within HTML (using namespaces), such an
      approach has not been
      adopted, and anecdotal comments from browser and assistive technology vendors have suggested this is not a viable
      approach.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-speech/">CSS Speech Module</a> is a retired W3C Working Group Note that
      describes mechanism by which content authors may apply a variety of speech styling and presentation properties to
      HTML. This approach
      has a variety of advantages but does not implement the full set of features required for pronunciation. <a
        href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-speech/#pronunciation">Section 16</a> of the Note specifically references the
      issue of pronunciation:</p>
    <blockquote>
      CSS does not specify how to define the pronunciation (expressed using a well-defined phonetic alphabet) of a
      particular piece of text within the markup document. A "phonemes" property was described in earlier drafts of this
      specification, but
      objections were raised due to breaking the principle of separation between content and presentation (the
      "phonemes" authored within aural CSS stylesheets would have needed to be updated each time text changed within the
      markup document). The
      "phonemes" functionality is therefore considered out-of-scope in CSS (the presentation layer) and should be
      addressed in the markup / content layer.
    </blockquote>
    <p>While a portion of CSS Speech was demonstrated by <a
        href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2011/519/">Apple in 2011 on iOS with Safari and VoiceOver</a>,
      it is not presently supported on any platform with any Assistive Technology,
      and work on the standard has itself been stopped by the CSS working group.</p>
    <p>Efforts to address this need have been considered by both assessment technology vendors and the publishing
      community. Citing the need for pronunciation and presentation controls, the IMS Global Learning Consortium added
      the ability to author SSML
      markup, specify PLS files, and reference CSS Speech properties to the Question Test Interoperability (QTI) <a
        href="https://www.imsglobal.org/apip/apipv1p0/APIP_QTI_v1p0.html">Accessible Portable Item Protocol</a> (APIP).
      In practice, QTI/APIP
      authored content is transformed into HTML for rendering in web browsers. This led to the dilemma that there is no
      standardized (and supported) method for inlining SSML in HTML, nor is there support for CSS Speech. This has led
      to the situation
      where SSML is the primary authoring model, with assessment vendors implementing a custom method for adding the
      SSML (or SSML-like) features to HTML using non-standard or data attributes, with customized Read Aloud software
      consuming those
      attributes for text to speech synthesis. Given the need to deliver accurate spoken presentation, non-standard
      approaches often include mis-use of WAI-ARIA, and novel or contextually non-valid attributes (e.g.,
      <code>label</code>). A
      particular problem occurs when custom pronunciation is applied via a misuse of the <code>aria-label</code>
      attribute, which results in an issue for screen reader users who also rely upon refreshable braille, and in which
      a hinted pronunciation
      intended only for a text to speech synthesizer also appears on the braille display.
    </p>
    <p>The attribute model for adding pronunciation and presentation guidance for assistive technologies and text to
      speech synthesis has demonstrated traction by vendors trying to solve this need. It should be noted that many of
      the required
      features are not well supported by a single attribute, as most follow the form of a presentation property / value
      pairing. Using multiple attributes to provide guidance to assistive technologies is not novel, as seen with
      WAI-ARIA where multiple
      attributes may be applied to a single element, for example, <code>role</code> and <code>aria-checked</code>. The
      <a href="https://w3c.github.io/publ-epub-revision/epub32/spec/epub-contentdocs.html#sec-xhtml-ssml-attrib">EPUB
        standard</a> for
      digital publishing introduced a namespaced version of the SSML <code>phoneme</code> and <code>alphabet</code>
      attributes enabling content authors to provide pronunciation guidance. Uptake by the publishing community has been
      limited, reportedly
      due to the lack of support in reading systems and assistive technologies.

    <h1>Core Features for Pronunciation and Spoken Presentation</h1>
    <p>The common spoken pronunciation requirements from the education domain serve as a primary source for these
      features. These requirements can be broken down into the following main functions that would support authoring and
      spoken presentation
      needs.</p>
    <section>
      <h2>Language</h2>
      <p>When content is authored in mixed language, a mechanism is needed to allow authors to indicate both the base
        language of the content as well as the language of individual words and phrases. The expectation is that
        assistive technologies and
        other tools that utilize text to speech synthesis would detect and apply the language requested when presenting
        the text.</p>
    </section>
    <seciton>
      <h2>Voice Family / Gender</h2>
      <p>Content authors may elect to make adjustments of those paramters to control the spoken presentation for
        purposes such as providing a gender specific voice to reflect that of the author, or for a character (or
        characters) in theatrical
        presentation of a story. Many assistive technologies already provide user selection of voice family and gender
        independent of any authored intent.</p>
    </seciton>
    <section>
      <h2>Phonetic Pronunciation of String Values</h2>
      <p>In some cases words may need to have their phonetic pronunciation prescribed by the content author. This may
        occur when uncommon words (not supported by text to speech synthesizers), or in cases where word pronunciation
        will vary based on
        context, and that context may not be correctly described.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>String Substitution</h2>
      <p>There are cases where content that is visually presented may require replacement (substitution) with an
        alternate textual form to ensure correct pronunciation by text to speech synthesizers. In some cases phonetic
        pronunciation may be a
        solution to this need.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Rate / Pitch / Volume</h2>
      <p>While end users should have full control over spoken presentation parameters such as speaking rate, pitch, and
        volume (e.g., WCAG 1.4.2 ), content authors may elect to make adjustments of those parameters to control the
        spoken presentation for
        purposes such as a theatrical presentation of a story. Many assistive technologies already provide user control
        speaking rate, pitch, and volume independent of any authored intent.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Emphasis</h2>
      <p>In written text, an author may find it necessary to add emphasis to an important word or phrase. HTML supports
        both semantic elements (e.g., <code>em</code>) and CSS properties which, through a variety of style options,
        make programmatic
        detection of authored emphasis difficult (e.g., <code>font-weight: heavy</code>). While the emphasis element has
        existed since HTML 2.0, there is currently no uptake by assistive technology or read aloud tools to present text
        semantically tagged
        for emphasis to be spoken with emphasis.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Say As</h2>
      <p>While text to speech engines continue to improve in their ability to process text and provide accurate spoken
        rendering of acronyms and numeric values, there can be instances where uncommon terms or alphanumeric constructs
        pose challenges.
        Further, some educators may have specific requirements as to how a numeric value be spoken which may differ from
        a TTS engine's default rendering. For example, the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium has developed <a
          href="https://portal.smarterbalanced.org/library/en/read-aloud-guidelines.pdf">Read Aloud Guidelines</a> to be
        followed by human readers used by students who may require a spoken presentation of an educational test, which
        includes specific examples
        of how numeric values should be read aloud.</p>
      <section>
        <h3>Presentation of Numeric Values</h3>
        <p>Precise control as to how numeric values should be spoken may not always be correctly determined by text to
          speech engines from context.&nbsp; Examples include speaking a number as individual digits, correct reading of
          year values, and
          the correct speaking of ordinal and cardinal numbers.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Presentation of String Values</h3>
        <p>Precise control as to how string values should be spoken, which may not be determined correctly by text to
          speech synthesizers.</p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Pausing</h2>
      <p>Specific spoken presentation requirements exist in the <a href="">Accessibility Guidelines from PARCC</a>, and
        include requirements such as inserting pauses in the spoken presentation, before and after emphasized words and
        mathematical
        terms. In practice, content authors may find it necessary to insert pauses between numeric values to limit the
        chance of hearing multiple numbers as a single value. One common technique to achieve pausing to date has
        involved inserting
        non-visible commas before or after a text string requiring a pause. While this may work in practice for a read
        aloud TTS tool, it is problematic for screen reader users who may, based on verbosity settings, hear the
        multiple commas announced,
        and for refreshable braille users who will have the commas visible in braille.</p>

    </table>
    <p>The following sections present how each of the required features may or may not be met by use of existing
      standards. A key considerationa in the analysis is whether a means exists to directly author (or annote) HTML
      content to incporate the
      spoken presentationa and pronunciation feature.</p>
    <section>
      <h3>Language</h3>
      <p>Allow content authors to specify the language of text contained within an element so that the TTS used for
        rendering will select the appropriate language for synthesis.<br /></p>

      <h4>HTML</h4>
      <p><code>lang</code> attribute can be applied at the document level or to individual elements. (WCAG) (AT
        Supported: some)<br /></p>
      <h4>SSML</h4>
      <p>Example: <code>&lt;speak&gt; In Paris, they pronounce it &lt;lang xml:lang="fr-FR"&gt;Paris&lt;/lang&gt;
          &lt;/speak&gt;</code>code></p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Voice Family/Gender</h3>
      <p>Allow content authors to specify a specific TTS voice to be used to render text. For example, content which
        presents a dialog between two people, a woman and a man, the author may specify that a female voice be used for
        the woman's text and a
        male voice be used for the man. Some platform TTS services may support a variety of voices, identified by a
        name, gender, or even age.</p>
      <h4>CSS</h4>
      <p><code>voice-family</code> property can be used to specify the gender of the voice.<br /></p>
      <p>Example: <code>{ voice-family: male; }</code></p>
      <h4>SSML</h4>
      <p>Using the <code>&lt;voice&gt;</code> element, the gender of the speaker, if supported by the TTS engine, can be
        specified.</p>
      <p>Example: <code>&lt;voice gender="female" &gt;Mary had a little lamb,&lt;/voice&gt;</code></p>

    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Phonetic Pronunciation</h3>
      <p>Allow content authors to precisely specify the phonetic pronunciation of a word or phrase.</p>
      <h4>PLS</h4>
      <h4>SSML</h4>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Substitution</h3>
      <p>Allow content authors to substitute a text string to be rendered by TTS instead of the actual text contained in
        an element.</p>
      <h4>WAI-ARIA</h4>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-label"><code>aria-label</code></a> and <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-labelledby"><code>aria-labelledby</code></a> attribute can be used
        by an author to supply a text string
        that will become the accessible name for the element upon which it is applied.&nbsp; This usage effectively
        provides a mechanism for performing text substation that is supported by a screen reader. However, it is
        problematic for one significant reason; for users who utilize screen readers and refreshable Braille, the
        content that is voiced will not match the content that is sent to the refreshable Braille device. This mismatch
        would not be acceptable for some content, particularly for assessment content.<br /></p>
      <h4>SSML</h4>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Rate/Pitch/Volume</h3>
      <p>Allow content authors to specify characteristics, such as rate, pitch, and/or volume of the TTS rendering of
        the text.</p>
      <h4>CSS</h4>
      <h4>SSML</h4>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Emphasis</h3>
      <p>Allow content authors to specify that text content be spoken with emphasis, for example, louder and more
        slowly. This can be viewed as a simplification of the Rate/Pitch/Volume controls to reduce authoring complexity.
